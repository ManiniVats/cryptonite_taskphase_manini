Useful Linux Commands

## cat: not the pet, but the command! 
`cat` is used for reading out files. It concatenates multiple files if provided multiple arguments.

Here, we need to read out the contents of the `flag` file situated in our home directory:
```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{I4t6A240O0K11PIAwijeU1MtXtf.dFzN1QDL5gDO0czW}
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$
```
Here we are rewarded with the flag `pwn.college{I4t6A240O0K11PIAwijeU1MtXtf.dFzN1QDL5gDO0czW}`, upon submitting of which, the challenge is completed.
